# 🏨 Hotel Booking Analysis

This project explores hotel booking data using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques to uncover trends in booking behavior, cancellations, seasonality, and customer preferences. The goal is to provide **actionable business insights** for hotel operations and strategic planning.

## 📊 Project Overview

The dataset includes booking records from **city and resort hotels**, with 119,000+ entries and 30+ features such as lead time, booking source, guest details, and cancellation status.

### 🔍 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw hotel booking data
- Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
- Visualize seasonal and behavioral booking trends
- Identify patterns in cancellations and revenue streams
- Provide business recommendations based on insights

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** for code and storytelling

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Highlights
- Removed missing/irrelevant values (e.g., agent, company)
- Converted date columns into proper datetime format
- Created new features like total nights, total guests, and month of arrival

## 📈 Key Analysis Performed
- **Univariate**: Distribution of hotel types, lead time, deposit types
- **Bivariate**: Relationship between lead time and cancellations, market segments vs booking count
- **Multivariate**: Heatmap correlations, guest vs night stays
- **Time Series**: Monthly trends for bookings and cancellations

## 💡 Key Insights
- 🏙️ **City hotels** see more bookings than resort hotels
- 🕒 **Longer lead times** lead to higher cancellations
- 🌐 **Online Travel Agencies (OTA)** dominate booking sources
- 📈 **Summer months** show spikes in both bookings and cancellations
- 💼 **Corporate bookings** generate higher average revenue

## 🧠 Recommendations
- Implement **dynamic pricing** based on lead time and season
- Encourage **direct bookings** through incentives
- Use **predictive alerts** for high-risk cancellations
- Target **corporate clients** and returning guests for loyalty

## 🔮 Future Work
- Build ML models for **cancellation prediction** and **demand forecasting**
- Use **customer segmentation** via clustering
- Integrate **external data** like holidays or weather
- Develop **interactive dashboards** (Power BI, Tableau)
